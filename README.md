# Covid-Tracker
# December 2019 was when notice was brought to the world about the first Covid-19 infection in Wuhan, China. Little did we know what the coming months had in store for us.
# This project visualizes the rapid spread of the virus into a global pandemic.
# We will use the following libraries; readr, dplyr and ggplot2.
